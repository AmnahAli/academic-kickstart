Abstract:
Nowadays, bike sharing systems are part of the transportation system for many cities around the world. The system is fixable and eco-friendly with many positive features, but there are some difficulties relating to the nature of the model on how to control the bikes availability in each station. There is a need to predict the demands on the stations every hour for efficient utilization and control the system to balance the needs of customers and bike availability. In order to overcome these obstacles, we have to demonstrate and predict the demand of bikes during weekdays and holidays. Moreover, we have to include the impact of the environmental conditions on the System such as season, weather, temperature and wind speed. We used available data from the City Bike Sharing System (CaBi) in Washington D.C., for 2011 and 2012. Our explanatory analysis showed variable interaction and the general counts trend, based on the previous factors we mentioned.
In addition, we produced many observations based on data exploration, and it showed that the system was growing and it had a rental trend and seasonal behaviour over the two years. In addition, we understand customer behaviour with respect to time and weather.
The problem of predicting the bike rental counts is a regression problem, so we focused on the linear and tree regression model. Therefore, we applied a set of supervised machine learning algorithms under the same assumption to compare their forecasting performance. Furthermore, we used model selection and evaluation techniques to build a prediction model with higher accuracy. Correspondingly, we used the root mean square error as a model evaluation metric.
As a result, we explored the random forest as a promise predictive model and we investigated different ways to improve it.
Key words: Bike sharing system, data analysis, supervised machine learning, regression, ensemble method, model selection and evaluation.
