Abstract:
information hiding become interest topics for large set of application such as military or government or competitive companies or e-commerce which exchange sensitive data need to sure and keep this information and communication securely specially will transfer it over the internet.
On branch into the information hiding science is the steganography science which keeps the secrecy unlike cryptography which keeps the privacy. Steganography is a digital technique for hiding secret information into some form of media, such as file, image, audio or video. Most of steganographic method concerns in two issues the capacity of payload such a spatial domain method and other concern in the quality and security of the stego file such a frequency domain method, both of two measures need to complete each other and keep load balance between them. The image steganography hide in digital image. The vital image steganographic method is the Least-Significant Bit (LSB) method, which used a noise or redundant part to embed the secret bits. There two way to used ether embed fixed same number of secret bits for each pixels in the cover image or an adaptive number based on some sort of information like in the Pixel-Value Difference (PVD) method and there improvement.
In this work, we present a new way take advantages form the PVD steganography technique to embed large amount of data in gray scale images while keeping the perceptual degradation to a minimum.
